# chest x-ray prediction

In this project, we will develop a deep learning model to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images. The model will be trained on a large dataset of chest X-ray images labeled with pneumonia diagnosis, as well as healthy control images. The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle datasets.

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate diagnostic tool that can assist medical professionals in the early detection of pneumonia. The model will be evaluated on its ability to correctly classify chest X-ray images as pneumonia positive or negative.

The images will be preprocessed using Data Pipeline.

Developing a deep learning model which is based on VGG16 architecture and training it on the preprocessed chest X-ray images dataset.

Evaluating the trained model on a separate validation dataset to assess its accuracy and using confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis to evaluate the model's performance.
